# Solution

## O(N) Loop

Iterate over the vector, stop at 'L' or 'R'. There are four cases where it stops:
1. xxxL...Rxxx
    This is the simplest case, the dots between L and R do not need any manipulation.
2. xxxR...Lxxx
    In this case, dots are equally divide into L and R parts.
3. xxxL...Lxxx
    In this case, dots are all transferred into L.
4. xxxR...Rxxx
    In this case, dots are all transferred into R.
